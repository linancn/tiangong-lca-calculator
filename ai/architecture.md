whenToUse:
  - when you need a compact mental model of the solver stack before editing crates, workers, or runtime SQL expectations
  - when deciding which crate or binary owns a behavior change
  - when snapshot build, package flow, or contribution-path analysis is mentioned without exact paths
whenToUpdate:
  - when major crate boundaries or job families change
  - when result persistence or runtime SQL boundaries move
  - when the current map becomes misleading

## Repo Shape

This repo is a Rust workspace with three core layers:

- `crates/suitesparse-ffi`
- `crates/solver-core`
- `crates/solver-worker`

The runtime solves sparse systems asynchronously and keeps heavy compute out of the API layer.

## Core Solver Invariants

Keep these constraints in mind before editing `crates/solver-core/**` or worker solve flows:

- The runtime solves the sparse system `Mx = b` with `M = I - A`; preserve that modeling contract when reshaping matrix-build code.
- Do not introduce explicit matrix inversion for solve paths. Reuse factorization or sparse-solve flows instead.
- Heavy recomputation belongs in async worker jobs, not inline request handlers or API-edge adapters.
- If a change affects factorization reuse, provider matching, or snapshot payload shape, review worker and persistence paths together.

## Stable Path Map

| Path group | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/suitesparse-ffi/**` | CSC matrix representation and SuiteSparse bindings |
| `crates/solver-core/**` | matrix build, factorization cache, solve orchestration, provider matching |
| `crates/solver-worker/src/**` | queue workers, package worker, snapshot builder, result persistence |
| `scripts/**` | manual validation, debug, diagnostics, and snapshot helpers |
| `tools/bw25-validator/**` | manual Brightway comparison tooling |
| `supabase/migrations/**` | local runtime-facing SQL expectations referenced by the calculator runtime |
| `docs/**` | runtime-facing contract and investigation docs |

## Current Runtime Families

### Solve and queue jobs

The worker currently covers families such as:

- `prepare_factorization`
- `solve_one`
- `solve_batch`
- `solve_all_unit`
- `invalidate_factorization`
- `rebuild_factorization`
- `analyze_contribution_path`
- `build_snapshot`

These flows belong to the calculator runtime, not to the API repo.

### Snapshot builder and provider matching

The snapshot builder path owns sparse payload generation, provider matching, and snapshot artifact metadata.

### Package worker

The package worker handles:

- `export_package`
- `import_package`

It also owns package-job artifacts and diagnostics.

### Result persistence

Result artifacts are persisted through the worker and supporting runtime storage flows instead of inlining heavy compute payloads into the API layer.

## Operational Baseline

- Solve result persistence is S3-only; treat `lca_results` as artifact metadata plus diagnostics, not as an inline result store.
- The worker DB pool currently uses a 5-minute idle timeout and a 30-minute max lifetime; keep equivalent long-running job headroom if you retune the pool.
- Queue enqueue and protected writes stay on service-side runtime paths guarded by existing RLS and `service_role` boundaries.
- Worker and snapshot paths require DB connectivity plus the required S3 env set before runtime validation is meaningful.

## Runtime SQL Boundary

This repo still documents and depends on runtime SQL expectations, but durable schema governance belongs in `database-engine`.

Use this rule:

- runtime compute truth here
- durable schema, migration, RPC, and policy truth there

## Cross-Repo Boundaries

- `edge-functions` owns request normalization, auth, enqueue, and polling API behavior
- `database-engine` owns durable schema governance
- `lca-workspace` owns root delivery completion after a child PR merges

## Common Misreads

- API behavior does not belong in the solver repo
- local migrations here are not the workspace-wide schema source of truth
- a merged child PR does not finish workspace delivery
